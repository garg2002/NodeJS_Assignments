// appending and reading data from file
 const append_data = "First of all, Node.js is a lightweight runtime. It uses an asynchronous, 
     event-driven I/O model which ensures that almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O. This time-saving operation 
     cuts down the time developers spend on deploying an application.Node.js offers both client-side and server-side in JavaScript. It means that applications written in Node.js require fewer files and less code as developers can reuse it for the frontend and backend parts of an application. As a result, your development team delivers faster results and you can cut down on personnel hours by hiring a team of full-stack developers â€” instead of separately bringing on a frontend and backend developer(s).The fact that Node.js is powered by the V8 engine by Google Chrome is beneficial itself. It compiles JavaScript to machine code before executing it which results in faster development. Google makes significant investments in the V8 engine improving its efficiency and security, which is why developers have more chances to deploy stable and high-performance applications."
